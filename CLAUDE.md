Handless is a cross-platform desktop speech-to-text app built with Tauri 2.x (Rust backend + React/TypeScript frontend).

## Design Context

### Users
Developers, power users, and general productivity users who want fast, accurate speech-to-text on desktop. They reach for Handless to dictate text instead of typing — notes, emails, messages, code comments. The app should feel like a native utility, not a complex tool requiring configuration.

### Brand Personality
**Calm, elegant, refined.** A premium desktop utility that feels thoughtfully crafted. Not flashy or attention-seeking — confident and understated, like a well-made instrument.

### Emotional Goals
- **Confidence & trust** — "My words are captured accurately"
- **Calm focus** — "It stays out of my way and lets me think"
- **Delight & craft** — "This feels really well-made"
- **Speed & efficiency** — "Everything feels instant"

### Aesthetic Direction
- **Reference:** Raycast — minimal, fast utility app with clean glass UI that stays out of the way
- **Anti-references:** Electron apps (Slack/Discord heaviness), generic SaaS dashboards, skeuomorphic decoration
- **Theme:** Dark-first with warm glass morphism. Orange accent (#ef6f2f) with warm neutrals
- **Typography:** Geist — modern, clean, highly legible
- **Motion:** Spring-based micro-interactions that feel responsive, never decorative

### Design Principles
1. **Invisible until needed** — The app should disappear into the user's workflow. Minimal chrome, no unnecessary UI. Like Raycast: summon it, use it, move on.
2. **Warmth over sterility** — Warm browns and orange accent prevent the glass aesthetic from feeling cold or clinical. The palette should feel inviting.
3. **Motion with purpose** — Every animation communicates state change (recording, processing, complete). No gratuitous animation. Spring physics for natural feel.
4. **Native-quality craft** — Should feel like a macOS-native app, not a web app in a wrapper. Tight spacing, precise typography, glass effects that match system vibrancy.
5. **Clarity over density** — Prefer generous whitespace and clear hierarchy. Settings and options should be discoverable but never overwhelming.
